SimpleCamera
==========
![](http://i.imgur.com/HaWziXn.png)

SimpleCamera is a module for Monkey which provides smoothly-interpolated camera constraints to a given viewport.  The constraints are symmetrical and the roaming window is axis-independant; However, the filtering amount is locked to the same value on both axes, and forward-focus anchors are not yet supported.

Functionality:
* Level constraints 
* Axis-independant window border size
* Interpolated window padding zone

Not yet implemented:
* Rotation
* Zoom
* Multiple focal points
* Dynamic anchors (forward-focus, etc)
